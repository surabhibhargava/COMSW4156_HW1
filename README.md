<p>This project was done as a part of my Computer Vision Course Project.</p>

<p>The algorithm is an implementation of the paper: Li, Shutao, Xudong Kang, and Jianwen Hu. "Image fusion with guided filtering." Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on 22.7 (2013): 2864-2875.</p>

opencv-3.1.0 with opencv_contrib are required to run the script.

To run the script: python GuidedFiltering.py

An example of filtering:

Image 1 | Image 2 | Fused Image
-|-|-
![Image 1](/assets/a09_1.png) | ![Image 2](/assets/a09_2.png) | ![Fused Image](/assets/a09_fused.png)
